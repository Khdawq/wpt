<title>Service Worker: 3P iframe for partitioned service workers</title>
<script src="resources/test-helpers.sub.js"></script>
<script src="/common/get-host-info.sub.js"></script>


<body>
This iframe will register a service worker when it loads and then add its own
iframe that will attempt to navigate to a url that service worker will intercept
and use to resolve the service worker's internal Promise.
<script>
// We should keep track if we installed a worker or not. If we did we need to
// uninstall it. Otherwise we let the top level test uninstall it.
var installed_a_worker = true;
var reg;

async function onLoad() {
  const script = './partitioned-storage-sw.js'
  const scope = './partitioned-'

  reg = await navigator.serviceWorker.register(script, { scope: scope });
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    // Check if a worker is already activated.
    var worker = reg.active;
    // If so, just resolve.
    if ( worker ) {
       installed_a_worker = false;
       resolve();
       return;
    }

    //Otherwise check if one is waiting.
    worker = reg.waiting;

    // If not waiting, grab the installing worker.
    if ( !worker ) {
      worker = reg.installing;
    }

    // Resolve once it's activated.
    worker.addEventListener('statechange', evt => {
      if (worker.state === 'activated') {
        resolve();
      }
    });
  });

  // Now make a call to the SW.
  const url_resolve = new URL('./partitioned-resolve.fakehtml?FromiFrame', self.location);
  const frame_resolve = await new Promise(resolve => {
    var frame = document.createElement('iframe');
      frame.src = url_resolve;
      frame.onload = function() { resolve(frame); };
      document.body.appendChild(frame);
  });

  // The call has been made, clean up and post a message.
  frame_resolve.remove();

  window.parent.postMessage('3p iframe succeeded', '*');
}

self.addEventListener('unload', async () => {
  // If we didn't install a worker then that means the top level test did, and
  // that test is therefore responsible for cleaning it up.
  if ( !installed_a_worker ) {
      return;
  }

    await reg.unregister();
  });

self.addEventListener('load', onLoad);
